        Hmm…how can we dress up an aluminum beer can to signal that the product is something special? Perhaps if Anheuser-Busch had known about the new matte/gloss decorating option from Ardagh, it might have gone that route.

Instead, packaging developers at A-B added a foil lid that wraps around and seals to the top of the can, over the usual pop-top lid. This elevates and differentiates its Mexican brand: Estrella Jalisco. The brand’s iconic star, or estrella, is featured on the foil lid.

While the company declined to share details about any production line changes (and, yes, there were some), Yonathan Bendesky, director, Mexican imports, at Anheuser-Busch did explain the marketing strategy: “Despite canned beer’s past perception, consumers are now considering and adopting canned beer at quicker rates. We are capitalizing on that trend and differentiating Estrella Jalisco by adding an extra layer of protection that also adds a premium element to our beer, which we hope will ensure that our consumers have an excellent experience when consuming our carefully crafted brew.”
