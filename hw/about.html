      Survey after survey shows that consumers want/demand easy-open packaging. So when is a harder-to-open package an advantage rather than a turn-off? When a childâ€™s health and safety are at risk.

Ever since their introduction, laundry pods, while convenient and effective, have been tied to an increase in child poisonings. Kids are attracted to their colorful designs, thinking they are candy.

Proctor & Gamble addressed the issue with opaque tubs and a triple-latch closure. It has now replaced that previous child-deterrent closure with a new child-resistant closure that makes it even more difficult for children to open the tub to gain access to the laundry pods.

Packaging Digest followed up with P&G to get more, exclusive details about the packaging improvement, which you can read by clicking the link in the headline above.
