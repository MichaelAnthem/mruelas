       When Kellogg’s lead packaging engineer Tom Hanel asked us if we were interested in hearing the story about the packaging for a new snack kit, we answered, “Yes!” Turns out you were pretty keen to learn about it, too. This article had the highest number of page views for the month of August 2017.

With the introduction of Keebler brand Town House Pita and Flatbread Cracker and Hummus Snack Boxes, Kellogg created a new option in packaging-driven convenience: on-the-go snacking. The assemble-your-own food kit includes crackers and shelf-stable hummus—without the need for utensils—for a healthy mobile snacking option.

Packaging distinctions include:

A paperboard grade typically used in beverage packaging applications that includes a moisture-resistant coating. Hanel explains that this material was chosen “due to potential exposure to moisture in lunchboxes and coolers.”

A large window on the carton’s front panel delivers visual appetite appeal.

A specially designed open-and-reclose tuck tab gives consumers easy access to the contents so they can enjoy the snack directly from the box. “Snackers will appreciate the design that eliminates the need for a plate or other utensils and allows them to keep their space clean and tidy,” Hanel says.

A peg-hole tab expanded the product’s channel distribution because of its value at airports, convenience stores and for other point-of-sale placements.
